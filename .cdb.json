    "long_description": "## Features\n\n* Removes TNT nodes placed within a configurable distance from spawn.\n* Configurable no TNT zone size using the setting `spawn_buffer_distance` in minetest config. (Default 1000)\n* Notifies the player of chat when attempting to place TNT\n* Uses `static_spawnpoint` as the centerpoint of the no TNT zone, falling back to `0, 0, 0` if not set.\n\n\n## Motivation \n\nI wanted to enable TNT in my public multiplayer world, but I was sure that griefers would misuse it and blow holes in the cool scenery, farms, and buildings that all the players have worked hard to create. I still wanted to have fun with TNT, but in a designated area. So I made this mod, which prevents players from placing TNT nodes within a configurable distance from spawn.",
